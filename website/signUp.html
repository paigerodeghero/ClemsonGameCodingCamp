<p> Computer Game Coding Camp for Autism is a two-week camp for high school students and rising seniors on the autism spectrum (ASD) that exposes them to high-level video game development and networking with peers.
  Throughout the two-week camp, campers learn the high-level processes of software development, game development, interpersonal communication, collaboration, and end up with their own game, from scratch.</p>

<p>We are excited to host this camp for the second year in a row. This year, our two-week coding camp will be provided in two formats, virtual through Zoom and in-person (on the Clemson University campus).
  Campers may participate fully online, fully in-person, or choose one week to be online and the other week to be in-person. It is recommended that campers register for both weeks.</p>

<p>In addition to learning to code, campers who reside on campus will participate in activities and instruction designed to further develop their executive functioning, problem-solving,
    and self-advocacy skills, which are necessary for college success.</p>
