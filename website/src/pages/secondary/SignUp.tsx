        Computer Game Coding Camp for Autism is a camp for high school students
        on the autism spectrum (ASD) that exposes them to high-level video game
        development and networking with peers. While developing their video
        game, students will improve their teamwork skills such as communication
        and collaboration. Throughout the camp, campers learn the high-level
        processes of software development, game development, interpersonal
        communication, collaboration, and end up with their own game, from
        scratch.
