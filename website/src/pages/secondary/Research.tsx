        For the past two summers, the CGCC team has been hosting these camps
        with the goal of introducing autistic students to their potential in
        video game development. While we will always keep this goal priority
        number 1, we also conduct these camps to perform research in autism and
        computer science education. Through the previous two camps alone, we
        have already found that events like these appear to help students
        improve their communication and collaboration skills, both of which are
        important to the field of computer science in general and are seen as
        challenges for autistic students. While we continue to try to make
        computer science more accessible to neurodiverse individuals, we aim to
        continue further developing the research field at the same time.
        However, we cannot achieve this without the help of you!

      <Section title="What does it mean to participate in CGCC Research">
        <p>
          By allowing your child to participate in the research aspects of the
          camp, you are allowing them to help us progress the field of computer
          science education for neurodiverse individuals. Taking part in the
          research aspects of the camp do not change the camp experience for
          students. In fact, your student likely wont even remember there was a
          research aspect to the camp at all. Part of the general camp
          experience is providing feedback at the end of the camp. We collect
          this feedback from every student in a group format so that next year
          we can attempt to make the camp an even better experience. By allowing
          your child to participate in the research side of camp, all you are
          consenting to is for us to use their anonymous responses in our
          publications, as well as any other points of interest we pick up when
          we review camp recordings (such as anonymized quotes that hint at an
          improvement in communication skills).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are on the fence about whether you should allow your child to
          participate in the research side of CGCC, or have any questions or
          concerns about how we do research at CGCC, feel free to reach out to
          us here!
