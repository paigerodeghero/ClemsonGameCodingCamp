    <h2 class="greenFont">Our Goals</h2>
    <p>
      For the past two summers, the CGCC team has been hosting these camps with the goal of introducing autistic students to their potential in video game development.
       While we will always keep this goal priority number 1, we also conduct these camps to perform research in autism and computer science education.
        Through the previous two camps alone, we have already found that events like these appear to help students improve their communication and collaboration skills,
         both of which are important to the field of computer science in general and are seen as challenges for autistic students. While we continue to try to make computer
          science more accessible to neurodiverse individuals, we aim to continue further developing the research field at the same time. However, we cannot achieve
           this without the help of you!

    <h2 class="greenFont">What does it mean to participate in CGCC Research?</h2>
    <p>
      By allowing your child to participant in the research aspects of the camp, you are allowing them to help us progress the field of computer science education for neurodiverse
      individuals. Taking part in the research aspects of the camp do not change the camp experience for students. In fact, your student likely wont even remember there was a 
      research aspect to the camp at all. Part of the general camp experience is providing feedback at the end of the camp. We collect this feedback from every student in a 
      group format so that next year we can attempt to make the camp an even better experience. By allowing your child to participate in the research side of camp, 
      all you are consenting to is for us to use their anonymous responses in our publications, as well as any other points of interest we pick up when we review camp
      recordings (such as anonymized quotes that hint at an improvement in communication skills).  
        <br>
        If you are on the fence about whether you should allow your child to participate in the research side of CGCC, or have any questions or concerns about how we do research at CGCC, feel free to reach out
        to us <a class="greenFont" href="mailto:cgcc@clemson.edu">here</a>!
