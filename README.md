# &#x1f42f; Computer Game Coding Camp for Autism &#x1f42f;
Computer Game Coding Camp (CGCC) for Autism is a summer camp for high school students and rising seniors on the autism spectrum (ASD) that exposes them to high-level video game development and networking with peers. Throughout the camp, campers learn the high-level processes of software development, game development, interpersonal communication, collaboration, and end up with their own game, from scratch.    

We are excited to host this camp for the *third* year in a row!
